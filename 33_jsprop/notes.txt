table creates a table
tr creates a new row
td creates cells in row

alerts take precedence by container size (smallest comes first then outermost last)

if .addEventListener has true, then it prioritizes the container its applied to but follows regular precedence from there
if multiple are true, then it prioritizes based on outermost container to innermost

stopPropagation stops the chain of alerts
